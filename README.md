A Robotic Arm I made in high school to pick up socks, but it could only pick up garlic. Has 5 degrees of freedom. Most parts are 3D-printed, and it runs on 4 MG996 servos, 2 MG90s servos, and an Arduino Uno. I lost all of the original code for the robot when I migrated my computer to Linux. Still, the code can be easily reconstructed from the included inverse kinematics calculations.

To produce the arm, you will need:
14 m4 screws + corresponding nuts
4 m2 screws
1 Rubber Band
4 MG996 Servos + included servo arms and screws
2 MG90s Servos + included servo arms and screws
Arduino Uno
5V/6V 8A Power Supply
1 of each 3D-printed part and 2 end effectors.

Simply assemble according to the assembly CAD.
